# Empty Encore TS Template

## Developing locally

When you have [installed Encore](https://encore.dev/docs/ts/install), you can create a new Encore application and clone this example with this command.

```bash
encore app create my-app-name --example=ts/empty
```

## Running locally

```bash
encore run
```

While `encore run` is running, open <http://localhost:9400/> to view Encore's [local developer dashboard](https://encore.dev/docs/ts/observability/dev-dash).
